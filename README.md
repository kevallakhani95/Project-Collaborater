# Project-Collaborator
Project Collaborator is a web application for student developers where they can find project partners who are willing to work on the same project. Students can browse through the projects uploaded by other users and get details about the project they are interested in. Integrated a project feed where users can view all the projects on project collaborator. Implemented a search bar to easily browse through projects based on programming language preferences.

To run the application:
1. Download and set up XAMPP and MySQL
2. Import pictures.sql file at localhost/phpmyadmin
3. Login using the credentials -
    
    Username: abc123
    Password: xyz
4. Enjoy the application :)
